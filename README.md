# Algorithm Challenge #17 – Triangle Area

## 🧮 Problem Description
This challenge focuses on calculating the **area of a triangle** using its **base** and **height**.  
It’s a fundamental geometry-based problem that helps strengthen your understanding of formulas and arithmetic logic in C++.

---

## 🧠 Formula
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

---

## 💡 What You’ll Learn
- How to take user input in C++
- How to apply mathematical formulas in code
- How to perform arithmetic operations
- Reinforcing the logic behind geometry-based calculations

---

## 🧩 Example
**Input:** 
Enter the base: 8
Enter the height: 5

**Output:**  
The area of the triangle is: 20
